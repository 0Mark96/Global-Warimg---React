        The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some of the reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, the albedo effect, and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 â€“ 3% of the arctic ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade!<br />        
        Another consequence is permafrost thawing. This is a process in which large amounts of methane is released to the atmosphere, fueling more the process of global warming.
